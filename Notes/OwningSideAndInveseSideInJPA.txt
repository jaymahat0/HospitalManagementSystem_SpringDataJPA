OWNING SIDE AND INVERSE SIDE IN JPA
=================================

1. INTRODUCTION
---------------
In JPA relationships (OneToOne, OneToMany, ManyToMany), Hibernate needs to know which entity controls the relationship.
This control is defined using Owning Side and Inverse Side.

Only the Owning Side is responsible for:
- Creating the foreign key
- Updating the relationship in the database

2. OWNING SIDE
--------------
The Owning Side is the entity that:
- Contains the foreign key column
- Uses @JoinColumn
- Controls INSERT and UPDATE operations

Key points:
- Only one owning side exists per relationship
- Hibernate reads relationship changes only from the owning side
- Changes made only on the inverse side are ignored

Example:
@OneToOne
@JoinColumn(name = "profile_id")
private Profile profile;

3. INVERSE SIDE
---------------
The Inverse Side (non-owning side):
- Does NOT contain the foreign key
- Uses mappedBy
- Depends on the owning side for database updates

Example:
@OneToOne(mappedBy = "profile")
private User user;

4. ROLE OF mappedBy
-------------------
mappedBy tells Hibernate that this side does not own the relationship.
It refers to the variable name in the owning entity.

5. IMPORTANT RULES
------------------
1. Foreign key is created only by the owning side
2. @JoinColumn appears only on the owning side
3. mappedBy appears only on the inverse side
4. Hibernate ignores changes made only on inverse side
5. Every bidirectional relationship has exactly one owning side

6. COMMON MISTAKES
------------------
- Using @JoinColumn on both sides
- Forgetting mappedBy
- Updating only inverse side

7. EXAM ONE-LINER
-----------------
The owning side maintains the foreign key and controls persistence, while the inverse side uses mappedBy and depends on the owning side.
